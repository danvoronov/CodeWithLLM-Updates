iterative**process where AI can learn, review, and improve its result.

✍️**Reflection**: an AI agent can evaluate its own code/result and refine it. This increases productivity.

🤖 Multi-agent systems: using**two or more agents**, such as an expert coder and an expert reviewer, significantly improves quality.

🔧 Using**tools**: connecting AI to various tools (web search, data analysis, etc.) expands its capabilities.

👷‍♂️**Planning**: AI agents can autonomously plan actions and change plans in case of failures, which is impressive.

🔀**Combining**all these approaches opens up new possibilities and improves AI results compared to simple code generation (there is a slide with a graph, but with a 40% axis).**That is, agent-based artificial intelligence technologies may be the next step in the field of software development.
