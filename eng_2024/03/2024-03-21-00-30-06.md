The author of the VS Code extension **Double**  says that he was motivated by two years of observing how the GitHub Copilot team did not fix [user interface flaws](https://docs.double.bot/copilot):
- incorrect closing of brackets,
- poor comment autocompletion,
- lack of auto-import of libraries,
- incomplete operation of the multi-cursor mode,
and all other problems of the outdated GPT-3.5 model (because GPT-4 is used where the system decides).

The latest version of Double integrates the **Claude 3 Opus model**  from Anthropic, which, according to some benchmarks, surpasses GPT-4. _In addition to Opus, GPT-4 Turbo is also present._ [Double.bot](Double.bot)  was accepted into the Y Combinator accelerator. 50 requests to any of these models per month are available for free. A full subscription costs $20 (and GitHub Copilot now costs $10 without slash commands, $19 with them).

_The extension is not on_ [open-vsx.org](open-vsx.org)_._
