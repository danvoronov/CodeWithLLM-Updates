CodiumAI, unlike other artificial intelligence systems for working with code, chose and occupied a narrow **niche**  - improving code quality (test generation, security and performance analysis).

Now their next step is the AlphaCodium system, which can _automatically_  check the quality of the generated code. In this way, it is similar to how GANs work. It is [open-source](https://github.com/Codium-ai/AlphaCodium)  on the OpenAI API key, and solves problems formulated in the [CodeContest](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/code_contests)  format JSON.
