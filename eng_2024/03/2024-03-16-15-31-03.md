 [AlphaCodium](https://www.codium.ai/products/alpha-codium)**from CodiumAI**CodiumAI, unlike other AI systems for working with code, chose and occupied a narrow**niche**- improving code quality (generating tests, analyzing security and performance).

Now their next step is the AlphaCodium system, which can_automatically_check the quality of generated code. This is similar to how GANs work. It's [open-source](https://github.com/Codium-ai/AlphaCodium)on OpenAI API keys and solves problems formulated in [CodeContest](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/code_contests)JSON format.
