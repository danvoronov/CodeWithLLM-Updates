Comparison [Codeium](https://codeium.com/)and GitHub CoPilot 

I don't like the unclear formulations of Codeium developers about what they use, because this is a system for programmers who will understand. Most likely, this is because they can provide it for free, and for auto-completion, a small-sized transformer like 2b is used, and for chat in the free version - GPT-3.5:_Codeium Autocomplete uses its own models, trained from scratch with its own forces. There is no dependence on open models, OpenAI, or other third-party APIs. Codeium Search uses a small, local model. No third-party APIs are used for search. Codeium Chat currently uses a combination of our own proprietary chat model and third-party OpenAI APIs_.
