Comparison of [Codeium](https://codeium.com/)  and GitHub CoPilot

I don't like the unclear wording of Codeium developers about what they use, because it is a system for programmers who will understand. Most likely because they can give it for free, for autocompletion a small transformer of about 2b is used, and for chat in the free version - GPT-3.5:

_Codeium Autocomplete uses its own models trained from scratch in-house. There is no dependency on open models, OpenAI, or other third-party APIs. Codeium Search uses a small, local model. No third-party APIs are used for search. Codeium Chat currently uses a combination of our own proprietary chat model and third-party OpenAI APIs._.
