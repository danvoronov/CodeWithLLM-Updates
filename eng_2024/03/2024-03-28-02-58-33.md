Since the launch of the [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)  project, the **GPT-4**  model has always been in first place. ([news](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-king-is-dead-claude-3-surpasses-gpt-4-on-chatbot-arena-for-the-first-time/) )

It is interesting that if at the beginning the GPT-3.5 model was impressive, now in comparison with new models it looks very weak and gives poor results. _We expect some change from the OpenAI company in the near future._
