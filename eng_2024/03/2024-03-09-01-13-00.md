[Pi.AI](https://pi.ai/)  updated their model to version 2.5 on March 7 ("we add IQ to exceptional EQ"). It generated a working HTML calculator for me, so they are telling the truth.

The feature of Pi from the very beginning was the imitation of conversation with short answers. Free.

_Chat GPT tried to make it possible to communicate by voice on mobile clients, and then the model's output became a little different, more like a conversation - here this is the idea of the system from the beginning.__Now Chat GPT can read messages by voice in the browser only with a Plus subscription, and here it is free._
