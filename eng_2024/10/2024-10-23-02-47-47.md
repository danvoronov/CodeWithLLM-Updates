ðŸ¤– Anthropic introduced new versions of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models, which significantly improved their performance.

ðŸ–¥ The biggest novelty is "using the computer / Agentic Computer Use" (beta) - the ability of Claude models to directly interact with the computer, open applications, perform tasks and **create code**.

ðŸ’» Demonstrations show that models can find information, fill out forms, fix errors and even create websites **on their own**.
