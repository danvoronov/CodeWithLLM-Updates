OpenAI announced a new ChatGPT feature for editing text or **code**  â€” Canvas. It allows you to move the chat to a separate panel and have an "editor window".

For text, it's cool that it allows you to make edits from AI on the side, like comments in Word. For code, there is a similar "Review code" button. In general, the functionality for code (so far?) is very basic and, unfortunately, does not have the ability to run, as it is in Claude Artifacts. But for simple projects, it's better than it was.

There is an interesting button for translating code into other programming languages, but the question remains who needs it (maybe if JS to TS). The add comments and logging buttons do not do this selectively, but almost on every line of code - this is bad.
