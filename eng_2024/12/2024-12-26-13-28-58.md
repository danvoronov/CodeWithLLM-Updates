**LLM from Google**  can finally do something

Now Gemini 2.0 Flash **as an experiment**  is free to use through Google AI Studio and API. It has a large context window - 2 million tokens (this is for input). üò≤

_Models from Google can be connected via API in Cursor settings (tab "Models"), but auto-patching from chat disappears and requires the Pro version, in my opinion, this is stinginess._

- demonstrates how to install and configure these tools. Talks about limitations through the API. ‚öôÔ∏è
- notes that Gemini 2.0 Flash works very fast and has excellent function calling capabilities. ‚ö°Ô∏è

On the Aider leaderboard, it is of course behind the top models, but you have to pay for them, and this is a Flash series model, i.e., simplified.
