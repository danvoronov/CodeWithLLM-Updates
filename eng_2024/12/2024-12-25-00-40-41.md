An interesting opinion [here in the comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42492753):

_With the development of artificial intelligence in programming, the price of (simple) software is heading to zero! Sometimes, it is much faster to "code" the function or utility you need yourself than to look for something ready-made._ 

Previously, developing even a small program required significant effort and time. Now, with the help of AI-based tools, the process of creating your own software is becoming fast and simple.

That is, until everything becomes AI and software disappears, there will be something transitional, and that is when those who know how will make their own programs, rather than use others'.
