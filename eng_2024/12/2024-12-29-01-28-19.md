 demonstrates **Cursor Composer**  Agent

Composer in Cursor is a tool that allows AI to create entire applications according to instructions. It significantly speeds up development, automating the creation of files, code, commands in the terminal. This can be especially useful if you want to quickly create a prototype or avoid routine work.

This cannot be used with your API key, you need to pay for Cursor Pro. _Some Cursor features (like Tab Completion, Apply from Chat, and Composer) require specialized models and wonâ€™t work with custom API keys_
