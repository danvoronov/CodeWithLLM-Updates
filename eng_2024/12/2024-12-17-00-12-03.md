**Windsurf** [https://codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) 

as a competitor to Cursor (at launch, it can also take settings from it). At the base, it's all the same VSC, so the interface does not need to be studied much.

You need a codeium account, this is a minus. There are three models - for money GPT 4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, free Cascade Base (this is like Llama 3 70B). I'm looking for what will work on my API keys, and there is no such option here, unfortunately.

It created an html calculator for me, but the "=" button is in the middle for some reason.

 draws an analogy with a 2015 car - "Tartan Prancer" (Honda from Albania) to illustrate that Windsurf creates the impression of a great tool, but in reality, it is unfinished. He compares it to colleagues at work who constantly redo everything. AI here constantly rewrites the code of many files, which makes you have to check everything constantly, and this is like starting from scratch.
