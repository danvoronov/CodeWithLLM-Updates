[https://www.phind.com/code?home=true](https://www.phind.com/code?home=true)**Phind launched a code mode in the browser** 

An experimental mode allows registered users to talk with code, and those who have Phind Pro can run and test code in the browser (so far only Python).

In addition, since 04/30, Phind has the ability to select the **phind instant**  model, which is a small-sized model. It is based on the Llama-3-8B model and is very, very fast.

_Phind ASK mode now intelligently decides when to search and when not to search the internet. It is set to prioritize search but will automatically avoid it when you change the code.__Chat mode now has a Playground name_.
