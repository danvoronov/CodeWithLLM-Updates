The author of the video expresses his deep skepticism ü§® about the new system **GitHub Copilot Workspaces**, which is presented as a "revolutionary" way of developing software using artificial intelligence.

The example from the demonstration of using Copilot Workspaces to add additional URL validation is considered üåê. The author criticizes that the plan proposed by Copilot included inappropriate changes, such as updating the README file and adding a [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)  file, which was not required by the original task. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This simple patch took an hour for the AI to generate.

The author also points out that Copilot Workspaces was unable to check for the presence of subdomains in GitHub URLs, which was a necessary part of the specification. ü§Ø This leads him to believe that either the tool is not sufficiently tested or its capabilities are still very limited.

Next, the author shares his alternative vision of what AI tools for developers should be. üí° He believes that these tools should complement, not replace, existing workflows. As an example, he demonstrates his experience using [Super Maven](https://supermaven.com/)  - an alternative to Copilot (also $10 per month), which, in his opinion, is much faster and more reliable in code autocompletion. üöÄ

_By the way, he uses the_ [hyped browser Arc](https://arc.net/)_, which has just become available on Windows_.
