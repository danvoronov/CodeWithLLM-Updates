 (GitHub CEO):

ðŸ¤– The revolution of artificial intelligence in programming: from complex "code hieroglyphs" to simple and natural communication with the machine, like with LEGO.

ðŸ§  "Today, any person, regardless of language, will have the power to talk to the machine".

ðŸ’» The new product "Copilot Workspace" allows you to create software in simple spoken language, without the need to write code.

ðŸ”® "By 2030, and possibly earlier, we will have over a billion software developers on GitHub. 10% of the world's population will control computers and will be able to create programs, like riding a bicycle".

ðŸŽ¨ "The floodgates are opening for a new renaissance of human creativity with software".

"Building software will become as simple and enjoyable as assembling LEGO".
