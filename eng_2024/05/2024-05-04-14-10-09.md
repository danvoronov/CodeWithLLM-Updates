Currently, AI is used only as an **assistant**  in writing code, but cannot completely replace a human.

ðŸ¤” - Despite the marketing hype around "AI programmers", they have not achieved the expected result.

1) User interfaces - it is necessary to take into account dynamic elements, dependencies, and context.

2) Service integration - it is necessary to correctly configure communication with external systems, the specifications of which change.
