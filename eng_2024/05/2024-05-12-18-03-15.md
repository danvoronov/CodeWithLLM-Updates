Presentation on [Replit Ghostwriter](https://replit.com/ai) 

ðŸŽ™ Mik Kasta, who is responsible for the AI direction at Replit, gave a presentation where he talked about the key features and capabilities of the platform, focusing on the Ghostwriter function - an AI assistant for programming.

ðŸ¤– The main idea that Mik promoted is to **simplify**  the process of creating software as much as possible with the help of AI technologies. He noted that Replit seeks to "turn an idea into a product" as quickly as possible, using **voice**  input, which is then converted into text and becomes the basis for the work of the AI code generator Ghostwriter.

ðŸ’» Mik demonstrated how Ghostwriter can help Replit users in various tasks, from writing a basic web page parser to deploying a Python-based application using the Flask framework. He also talked about plans for the development of this technology, calling it "Artificial Developer Intelligence", which will be able not only to generate code but also to plan and debug tasks on its own.

âœ¨ _The generated parser code did not actually work, and the system refused to finish it..._ 

ðŸ§  The key point of the presentation was Mik's belief that **cooperation**  between a human and an AI assistant in programming is not something to be feared, but on the contrary, a new opportunity to increase productivity. He urged the audience not to be shy about using such tools, because changes in the IT industry are a natural process, as in other areas of human activity.
