 how you can create a file with the GPT extension. This allows you to write programs in plain (here English) language. You simply describe the steps: for example, the program expects a photo to be uploaded 📸, extracts a list of ingredients from the photo 🍎🍞, creates a file with these ingredients 📄, and then suggests a recipe 🍲. GPTScript automatically makes all network requests to OpenAI to make this work. 🌐
