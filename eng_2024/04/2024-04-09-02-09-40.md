Video "Why I stopped using Copilot":

    🧠 If you don't practice skills, you can lose them. Using Copilot influenced the way I wrote code, prompting me to wait for AI hints instead of using my own brain.

    👨‍💻 Writing code became less interesting. Copilot deprived me of the opportunity to learn, be creative, and solve problems on my own, which I enjoyed.

    🔍 The quality of Copilot's hints was unstable - often they were outdated or contained errors. I had to check the documentation, which reduced efficiency.

    🔒 Privacy is a big problem. Every time I used Copilot, fragments of my code were sent to a remote server, which is unacceptable to me as a supporter of privacy and self-hosting.
