[https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/](https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/)**GitHub introduces Copilot Workspace in TechPreview - a new AI-based development environment** 

GitHub Copilot Workspace is an updated development environment where programmers can work with code in plain language 💬. The system can help developers from the very beginning - planning the task ✅, writing specifications 📄, and generating code 💻.
All this can be edited and refined ✏️.

The environment is integrated with GitHub Issues 📥, Pull Requests 🔃, and repositories 🗃.

Developers can run and test code directly in Copilot Workspace 🚀. This allows to simplify and speed up the entire software development cycle ⏱.

For professional developers, Copilot Workspace will allow more focus on system thinking 🧠 and move away from routine work that can be automated ⚙️.
