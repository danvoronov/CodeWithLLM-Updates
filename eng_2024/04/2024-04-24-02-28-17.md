ðŸ†• In the latest update of [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), Copilot++ has been improved and the "Help" section has been made in the form of an AI chat (currently in beta).

This video review shows how Copilot++ can automatically generate code based on the context of the current project. The process of creating an interactive node graph in the Vue.js framework is demonstrated using hints and commands provided by Copilot++.

The main features of Copilot++ demonstrated in the video:

1. Autocompletion of code on several **lines**  simultaneously.
2. Understanding the project context to provide relevant code suggestions.
3. Ability to **add**  documentation as reference materials for AI.
4. Flexible control of code generation through text instructions.

The video emphasizes that using AI assistants like Copilot++ allows developers to focus on high-level logic instead of writing individual lines of code. This can significantly increase productivity and remain relevant in the context of rapid technology development.
