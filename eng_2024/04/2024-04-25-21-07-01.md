In **Groq**  on their YouTube channel, there is a demo of the project [iter](https://github.com/freuk/iter)  on the mixtral-8x7b-32768 model in the terminal on nix-shell. I have not tested it - his approach is to print everything and have minimal control over generation.

1:53 But there is a cool feature, the command **reflextion**  - when the model will receive 6 requests with the instruction to think about the problem.

_The video is from March 8, and now there is also llama3-70b-8192 - but 8k versus 32k context window._ 

For VSCode in the extensions catalog, I found [Groqopilot v0.0.81](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unclecode.groqopilot), but now it is more likely not working than working.
