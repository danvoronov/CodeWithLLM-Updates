[https://ollama.com/library/phi3](https://ollama.com/library/phi3)**A new version of the model from MS Phi-3 mini has been added to the ollama catalog.** 

Despite its relatively small size of 3.8B, this model, according to the developers, demonstrates high efficiency in working with logic and mathematical tasks.

During the training of Phi models, an approach similar to teaching children using "textbook-like" materials in mathematics, logic, and **programming**  was used. It is expected that this method will improve the overall results of the model in these areas.

_Also, an advantage of the new model is a version with a large context window - 128k tokens._
