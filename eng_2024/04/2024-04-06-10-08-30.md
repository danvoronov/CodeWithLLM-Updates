In [Phind](https://www.phind.com/)  there are now 5 (10 for users) free **requests for 70b**  per day. Previously, this option was for GPT-4.

There is also a tab called 'ask a question about your code', marked as experimental, and there is no way to test it on the $10 plan, you need to upgrade to $20.

I suspect this should connect the repository, but on the paid plans description page there are no details yet.
