Cody now supports the new Claude 3 family of models from Anthropic, which includes three models: Haiku (the fastest), Opus (the smartest), and Sonnet (intermediate).

These models demonstrate improvements in code generation, the ability to quickly recall information from a large context, and other characteristics important for Cody.

ðŸ†“ For Cody Free users, the **Sonnet model (4th in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena rating) is now used by default**, replacing Claude 2.0 (15th in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena rating).

Cody **Pro**  users can choose between Haiku (8th in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena rating), Sonnet, and Opus (1st in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena rating)
