A new player has emerged that aims to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic - the company [Reka AI](https://www.reka.ai/).

Currently, they have three models:
**ðŸŸ§ Edge**: a lightweight model with 7b parameters.
**ðŸŸ§ Flash**: a fast and powerful model with 21b parameters.
**ðŸŸ§ Core**: the largest and most powerful model for complex tasks (size unknown).

In non-multimodal tests of code generation from text instructions, it seems that Core is inferior to GPT-4 and Claude-3-Opus.
