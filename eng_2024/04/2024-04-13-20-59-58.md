A set of **open**  models from Google for writing code [CodeGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/codegemma)  added to [ollama](https://ollama.com/library/codegemma:latest)  (which is supported by Cody) and catalog.ngc.nvidia [7B](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/codegemma_7b_base)  and [2B](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/codegemma_2b_base)  - I did not find any full-fledged reviews and comparisons, perhaps, no one is interested in this.

I also did not find in Google a direct indication of the size of the context window of these models.
