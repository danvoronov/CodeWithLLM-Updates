[Bito](https://bito.ai/)  is the most similar product to Github Copilot, but with a limited free plan (100 additions per month, 20 chat messages per day).

ðŸ¤– The video is about the new Bito AI [Code Review Agent](https://bito.ai/ai-code-review-agent/), which helps to reduce time on code review by 50% and improve code quality (works only in the $15/month plan, but there is a trial).

ðŸ”§ The agent integrates with GitHub and GitLab, automatically performs static code analysis, checks for vulnerabilities, and provides detailed comments with recommendations for code improvement.
