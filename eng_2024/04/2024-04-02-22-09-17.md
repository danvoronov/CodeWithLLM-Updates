 [Bito](https://bito.ai/)is most similar to Github Copilot, but with a limited free plan (100 completions per month, 20 messages per day in chat).

ðŸ¤– The video talks about the new Bito AI [Code Review Agent](https://bito.ai/ai-code-review-agent/), which helps reduce code review time by 50% and improve code quality (only works in the $15/month plan, but there's a trial).

ðŸ”§ The agent integrates with GitHub and GitLab, automatically performs static code analysis, checks for vulnerabilities, and provides detailed comments with recommendations for improving the code.
