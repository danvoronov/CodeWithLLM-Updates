**Artifacts**  â€” in the video, a leak of details about the new Claude feature: not code written by programmers, but an effectively formulated query to the LLM.

The new feature, according to the leak, demonstrates how well-structured queries can effectively manage large amounts of information, creating meaningful content that users can easily adapt and reuse. This opens up new perspectives for software development, where the key role is played by the ability to correctly query the LLM at the beginning, and not just program.
