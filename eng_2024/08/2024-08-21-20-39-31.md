The company Ccosine presented the AI model Genie **specifically**  for software engineering (automatic code writing like Devin). They say it was trained on special data that reproduces the logic and processes of programmers.

They say the model is capable of:
    Analyzing and breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks.
    Searching and finding relevant code fragments to make changes.
    Generating, verifying, and improving code, solving tasks as an engineer does.
    Performing a wide range of tasks, from developing new features to fixing bugs, refactoring, and writing tests.

Genie adapts to different programming languages.

Currently, access to Genie is only possible through a waitlist.
