This video is about how AI programming is developing as a product. The author - Patrick Debois - demonstrates the new capabilities that have appeared in various IDEs and tools for developers thanks to AI. Instead of simple code completion, AI can now perform multi-file editing, select context, etc.

Patrick also describes how developers can expand the context for AI by adding documentation, style guides, terminals, and other sources of information. This allows for more accurate and efficient results from AI.

⚠️ The key point is that the role of the developer is changing - now more time is spent reviewing and evaluating what the AI has generated, instead of directly writing code.

Patrick talks about mechanisms to facilitate this process, such as automatic change highlighting, step-by-step presentation of results, and feedback.
