Comparison [https://codeium.com/](https://codeium.com/) to GitHub CoPilot 

I don't like the unclear formulations of Codeium developers about what they use, as this is a system for programmers who will understand. Most likely, because they can give it away for free, a small-sized transformer, something like 2b, is used for autocompletion, and GPT-3.5 is used for chat in the free version:

Codeium Autocomplete uses its own models, trained from scratch with its own forces. There is no dependency on open models, OpenAI, or other third-party APIs. Codeium Search uses a small, local model. No third-party APIs are used for search. Codeium Chat currently uses a combination of our own proprietary chat model and third-party OpenAI APIs.
