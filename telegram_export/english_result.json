This allows for more accurate and efficient results from AI.\n\n⚠️ The key point is that the role of the developer is changing - now more time is spent reviewing and evaluating what the AI has generated, instead of directly writing code.\n\nPatrick talks about mechanisms to facilitate this process, such as automatic change highlighting, step-by-step presentation of results, and feedback."

He makes a clear distinction between \"Software 1.0\" (traditional manual coding) and \"Software 2.0\" (AI model-oriented learning).\n\n🧠 Karpathy argues that neural networks are not just another tool in the machine learning kit, but the beginning of a new software paradigm. Unlike explicit coding in SW 1.0, SW 2.0 relies on training models through large amounts of data to identify patterns and rules.\n\n🚘 This transition is already observed in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and autonomous vehicles, where neural networks outperform traditional algorithms.\n\n📚 However, Karpathy acknowledges certain challenges associated with the transition to SW 2.0. In particular, he notes that programming through adjusting the weights and biases of neural networks is much less intuitive and understandable for people than traditional coding.\n\n🔍 Thus, the main challenge is to create more intuitive tools and methods that would allow developers and users to better understand and interact with neural networks - a key component of this new software paradigm.\n\n🔮 Karpathy's conclusion is that, just as \"Software 1.0 is eating the world\", now \"Artificial Intelligence or Software 2.0 is eating Software\". This is an exciting prospect of the evolution of technology that is changing the very nature of software development.\n\n"

Copilot deprived me of the opportunity to learn, be creative, and solve problems on my own, which I enjoyed.\n\n    🔍 The quality of Copilot's hints was unstable - often they were outdated or contained errors.
