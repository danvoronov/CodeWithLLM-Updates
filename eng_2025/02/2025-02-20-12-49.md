**OpenAstra**
project is in the alpha stage.

Instead of traditional tools (Postman / Insomnia / Yaak), it offers interaction with APIs through a *chat interface (like ChatGPT)*. The author believes this simplifies understanding and testing.

The chat supports various LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, and allows the use of OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or other compatible APIs.

Thanks to Docker, deploying OpenAstra can be done in minutes.
