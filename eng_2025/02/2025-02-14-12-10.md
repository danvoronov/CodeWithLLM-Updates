Cursor's journey began by essentially cloning GitHub Copilot's in-editor code completion. They initially called it **Copilot++** and steadily improved it, focusing on its ability to understand multiple lines of code.

By mid-2024, the feature was rebranded as **Cursor Tab** (a nod to its activation method by Tab button ðŸ˜‰) â€” reflecting gains in speed and accuracy. And just a month ago, they [announced a new model](https://www.cursor.com/blog/tab-update) called **Fusion**, which improves support for large files.

*Now, competitors are scrambling to catch up.*

**Windsurf** yesterday [announced Wave 3](https://codeium.com/blog/windsurf-wave-3). Beyond supporting MCP tools ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), also found in [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)), they've enhanced their in-editor autocompletion model, called the feature "Tab-to-jump."

And **GitHub Copilot** itself isn't standing still. They currently have a feature called "Next Edit Suggestion" in preview â€“ you need to activate it in the settings ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbUnwaSllTY)).
