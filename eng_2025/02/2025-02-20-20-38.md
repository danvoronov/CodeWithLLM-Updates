A new model has been released, it's from Elon Musk - **Grok 3**. According to [their benchmarks](https://x.ai/blog/grok-3), it's currently the best performing LLM available. It's currently free to use on the website [http://grok.com/](http://grok.com/), but there's no API access yet, so none of our plugins or IDEs are updating. By the way, Grok 2 is available in Cursor.

[Trea](https://www.trae.ai/home) (a Chinese Cursor clone) has finally released a Windows build. It's completely **free**, but only offers two models: `GPT-4o` and `Claude-3.5-Sonnet`. It has a built-in Webview. There are no checkpoints. There's no MCP. And, of course, there's no opt-out for tracking.

[Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) has been updated to version 3.4. 
In addition to improvements to the checkpoint interface, and additional contexts for git and the terminal, there's now an **MCP Marketplace** catalog – you can install necessary tools with a single click.
