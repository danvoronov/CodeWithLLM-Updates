On the [Aider LLM Leaderboards](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/), for several days now, the first place has been occupied not by a single model, but by the combination of **DeepSeek R1** and **claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022**.

This setup likely inspired the creation of the

**DeepClaude** 0.1.0 
[https://deepclaude.com/](https://deepclaude.com/)  

Currently, DeepClaude is a very minimalist **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys)** open-source system built in Rust - [repo](https://github.com/getAsterisk/deepclaude). It was created by _An Asterisk_ as a side project and requires users to pay two providers and input their API keys. Interestingly, it’s unclear why the developers didn’t opt to integrate with [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) instead — perhaps someone will code this.

The system can be used on their website or deployed locally. _It’s not an IDE or a plugin — just a chat interface powered by two models._
