(previously OpenDevin)

Open Source Python tool inspired by [Devin](https://app.devin.ai/) ', launching agents for programming: writes code, executes commands, goes online.

Runs through Docker, they advise using anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, but you can also use Gemini and DeepSeek - configured by entering an API key. The solution is automatic with a large number of requests, so it consumes a lot of tokens.

There is a waiting list to try their hosted version.
