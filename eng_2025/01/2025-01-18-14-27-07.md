[https://thegroundtruth.substack.com/p/devin-first-impressions](https://thegroundtruth.substack.com/p/devin-first-impressions) [Devin](https://app.devin.ai/)  (v1.1.0, as of 15 January 2025) - a promising tool with the best UX among analogues, but still at an early stage of development.

_Potentially, it can significantly change the software development process after addressing the current shortcomings. Currently, according to the author, it is worth its $500 per month.__(It is worth noting that on the tariff plan page, $500 is indicated as a "discounted price", while the initial crossed-out price is $1250)_**Main advantages:** 
It has a user-friendly interface and simple setup. It demonstrates high speed in performing simple tasks. An interesting feature is the ability to analyze (“visually see“) web pages using screenshots. Devin also supports parallel work on multiple tasks and in some cases can make intelligent decisions, for example, automate repetitive actions.

**Main disadvantages:** 
Slowly works with more complex tasks that require code refactoring or debugging. Sometimes it gets into an infinite editing loop. Its capabilities are limited: there is no access to sites with authentication (for example, it cannot visit the GitHub website and see the created PR). There is a decrease in performance during a long session (2.5 hours or 10 ACUs), as well as difficulties in using the knowledge base.
