The code analyzer, analyzing linearly, often got stuck in details. To improve the analysis, we changed the approach, modeling the Mindset of experienced developers:

**üìù File grouping**: files are grouped by functionality (e.g., "authentication", "database").

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Context**: a description of the group's functionality within the overall architecture is added before code analysis. Impact analysis: consider changes in relation to the **entire**  system

üï∞ Historical understanding: track why the code evolved in a certain way

prompt to the group


The result was an improvement in the quality of understanding, from simple observations to identifying potential problems, such as conflicts and relationships between components.
