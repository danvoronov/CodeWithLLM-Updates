[https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-2501/](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-2501/) 

Mistral AI introduced an updated model **Codestral 25.01**, which improves the speed and accuracy of code generation, especially in "fill-in-the-middle" (FIM) tasks.

_It really generates quickly. For some reason, the model has become worse in Java, but added % HumanEval in Python / C++ / Javascript_ 

You can check it through [Continue.dev](Continue.dev)  or via the openai compatible API (codestral-latest model) - [key in the console](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral) 

The model in the console is not yet displayed in the limits section, most likely now is the test period.

VS code - [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)  [3.1.9] & [Roo Cline](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Cline)  [3.1.6]
- Add _Mistral_  API provider with codestral-latest model
