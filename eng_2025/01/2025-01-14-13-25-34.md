A platform for automatic full-stack generation using the "Prompt to edit" approach.

Generated projects are added to the public catalog for free, and you can continue to do something of your own on top of other people's projects. There are also templates. They give 5 chat messages per day for free. There is no downloading to your disk, but there is a possibility to export to your github as a repository.

In beta now is the integration with supabase (authentication and db)
