The video **compares Bolt and Lovable**, two AI tools for creating web applications.

The author gives both platforms the same task: to create a Trello-like application with draggable elements.
- Bolt generated the initial version a little faster than Lovable.
- Both applications allowed creating tasks and moving them between columns, but not editing.

Both tools quickly added this feature after the corresponding request.

When the author asked to change the design to Spotify style, both AIs successfully changed the color scheme to dark with green accents.
- Bolt in this case offered a more interesting highlighting effect when hovering over the buttons.

When adding functionality for multiple boards, 
- Bolt implemented switching between them via a dropdown menu, and Lovable placed the board names in the top navigation bar, which the video author liked more.

In general, both tools are effective for rapid development, but the choice between them may depend on the user's priorities:
- Bolt may be better for those who value speed, and Lovable â€“ for those who prefer a more intuitive "out of the box" interface

PS from me: [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)  is a closed product (formerly GPT Engineer), where 5 requests/day are free and you cannot save the code directly. [Bolt.new](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new)  and fork [bolt.diy](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy)  are available on github - you can install it on your computer or use the website [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)
