The Chinese startup DeepSeek continues to delight us with cheap clones. Here they got to openai o1.

Through the API, if you use it ([directly](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)  or through [openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-r1) ), you have to pay - an already generated key will do, you just need to change the model to deepseek-reasoner. It costs 4 times cheaper than o1.

Now it is not in the list in Cline and Aider - we are waiting for updates. But you can already throw your DeepSeek API key through OpenRouter, or pay them.

Through the [web interface](https://chat.deepseek.com/)  and their new phone app, you can use it for free. Canvas/Artifacts have not yet been copied.
