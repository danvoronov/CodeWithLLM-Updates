In general, the functionality for code (so far?) is very basic and, unfortunately, does not have the ability to run, as it is in Claude Artifacts. But for simple projects, it&#39;s better than it was.</p>\n<p>There is an interesting button for translating code into other programming languages, but the question remains who needs it (maybe if JS to TS). The add comments and logging buttons do not do this selectively, but almost on every line of code - this is bad.</p>\n","date":"2024-10-04T23:46:44","month":10},{"title":"2024-10-02 23:43","content":"<p>üìé <a href=\"2024-10-02-23-43-10.mp3\">AIs talks about PearAI.mp3</a></p>\n<p>Generated in notebooklm</p>\n","date":"2024-10-02T23:43:10","month":10},{"title":"2024-10-02 19:27","content":"<p><a href=\"https://trypear.ai/\">https://trypear.ai/</a><strong>PearAI</strong>  called themselves open source Cursor - they forked VSCode (editor) and <a href=\"https://github.com/continuedev/continue\">Continue</a>  (AI programming assistant) - this caused a small quarrel with Continue over ownership and license type, which added PR to them (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/y-combinator-is-being-criticized-after-it-backed-an-ai-startup-that-admits-it-basically-cloned-another-ai-startup/\">TechCrunch</a> )</p>\n<p>PS there was already an open source clone of Cursor <a href=\"https://voideditor.com/\">https://voideditor.com/</a></p>\n","date":"2024-10-02T19:27:27","month":10},{"title":"2024-09-21 00:54","content":"<p>in Cursor AI added o1-preview and o1-mini</p>\n<p>since 09/19 OpenAI models o1-preview and o1-mini are now also in github copilot</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/try-out-openai-o1-in-github-copilot-and-models/\">https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/try-out-openai-o1-in-github-copilot-and-models/</a></p>\n","date":"2024-09-21T00:54:29","month":9},{"title":"2024-09-13 17:11","content":"<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eHz-xLSs50o\">https://youtu.be/eHz-xLSs50o</a></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">\n          <iframe \n            width=\"100%\" \n            height=\"400\" \n            src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eHz-xLSs50o\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" \n            allowfullscreen>\n          </iframe>\n        </div>\n      </p>\n<p>The video compares the performance of two top AI models - OpenAI o1 and Anthropic Sonnet 3.5 - in creating a 3D game <strong>with physics</strong>  of car parking.</p>\n<p>üöó Sonnet 3.5 failed the task, giving an uncontrollable car, while o1-preview was able to generate the basic functionality of the game. o1 made a controllable car with tire tracks with a 0-shot prompt.
