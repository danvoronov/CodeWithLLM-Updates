The model is trained on all text and open source code on the Internet and can generate executable code based on natural language prompts.</p>\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the importance of ensuring high quality of input data and values during model training to prevent bias and unwanted behavior. He also sees the potential of CodeX in programming education, as the model can provide explanations and guidance in the form of code.

Performance can vary depending on the type of task and context.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that there is no point in delving too deeply into a detailed comparison of the positions of models in the leaderboards. Instead, it is better to divide them into several groups: leaders, middle, and laggards.
