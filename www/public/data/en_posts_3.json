Andrew Ng (he has many courses on AI) demonstrates on slides advanced methods for using large language models to improve the software development process.</p>\n<p>The main ideas of the speech:</p>\n<p>üß† Agent approaches in AI are becoming increasingly popular and effective. This is an <strong>iterative</strong>  process where AI can learn, review, and improve its result.</p>\n<p>‚úçÔ∏è <strong>Reflection</strong>: An AI agent can evaluate its own code/result and refine it. This increases productivity.</p>\n<p>ü§ñ Multi-agent systems: using <strong>two or more agents</strong>, such as an expert coder and an expert reviewer, significantly improves the quality.</p>\n<p>üîß Using <strong>tools</strong>: connecting AI to various tools (web search, data analysis, etc.) expands its capabilities.</p>\n<p>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <strong>Planning</strong>: AI agents can autonomously plan actions and change the plan in case of failures, which is impressive.</p>\n<p>üîÄ <strong>Combination</strong>  of all these approaches opens up new possibilities and improves AI results compared to simple code generation (there is a slide with a graph, but with a 40% axis).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc</a></p>\n<p>\n            <div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">\n              <iframe \n                width=\"100%\" \n                height=\"400\" \n                src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sal78ACtGTc\" \n                frameborder=\"0\" \n                allowfullscreen>\n              </iframe>\n            </div>\n          </p>\n<p><em>That is, agent-based artificial intelligence technologies may be the next step in the field of software development.</em></p>\n","date":"2024-03-29T20:36:42","month":3},{"title":"2024-03-28 11:54","content":"<p>Stability AI presented, and olllama added to the repository the <strong>instruct</strong>  version of their code generation model <strong>Stable Code</strong>.
