He makes a clear distinction between &quot;Software 1.0&quot; (traditional manual coding) and &quot;Software 2.0&quot; (AI model-oriented learning).</p>\n<p>üß† Karpathy argues that neural networks are not just another tool in the machine learning kit, but the beginning of a new software paradigm. Unlike explicit coding in SW 1.0, SW 2.0 relies on training models through large amounts of data to identify patterns and rules.</p>\n<p>üöò This transition is already observed in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and autonomous vehicles, where neural networks outperform traditional algorithms.</p>\n<p>üìö However, Karpathy acknowledges certain challenges associated with the transition to SW 2.0. In particular, he notes that programming through adjusting the weights and biases of neural networks is much less intuitive and understandable for people than traditional coding.</p>\n<p>üîç Thus, the main challenge is to create more intuitive tools and methods that would allow developers and users to better understand and interact with neural networks - a key component of this new software paradigm.</p>\n<p>üîÆ Karpathy&#39;s conclusion is that, just as &quot;Software 1.0 is eating the world&quot;, now &quot;Artificial Intelligence or Software 2.0 is eating Software&quot;. This is an exciting prospect of the evolution of technology that is changing the very nature of software development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozEZbqzPyFM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozEZbqzPyFM</a></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">\n          <iframe \n            width=\"100%\" \n            height=\"400\" \n            src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ozEZbqzPyFM\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" \n            allowfullscreen>\n          </iframe>\n        </div>\n      </p>\n","date":"2024-09-10T23:11:15","month":9},{"title":"2024-08-21 20:39","content":"<p><a href=\"https://cosine.sh/blog/genie-technical-report\">https://cosine.sh/blog/genie-technical-report</a> </p>\n<p>The company Ccosine presented the AI model Genie <strong>specifically</strong>  for software engineering (automatic code writing like Devin).

He also talked about plans for the development of this technology, calling it &quot;Artificial Developer Intelligence&quot;, which will be able not only to generate code but also to plan and debug tasks on its own.</p>\n<p>‚ú® <em>The generated parser code did not actually work, and the system refused to finish it...</em> </p>\n<p>üß† The key point of the presentation was Mik&#39;s belief that <strong>cooperation</strong>  between a human and an AI assistant in programming is not something to be feared, but on the contrary, a new opportunity to increase productivity. He urged the audience not to be shy about using such tools, because changes in the IT industry are a natural process, as in other areas of human activity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ollama.com/codegpt/replit-code-v1_5-3b\">model replit-code-v1_5-3b on ollama</a></p>\n","date":"2024-05-12T18:03:15","month":5},{"title":"2024-05-08 02:47","content":"<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dLaOQLXTM10\">https://youtu.be/dLaOQLXTM10</a></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">\n          <iframe \n            width=\"100%\" \n            height=\"400\" \n            src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dLaOQLXTM10\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" \n            allowfullscreen>\n          </iframe>\n        </div>\n      </p>\n<p>A week ago, Amazon Q was introduced - a programmer&#39;s assistant that specializes in code generation, testing, debugging, and can be used at various stages of the software development lifecycle.</p>\n<p>The video demonstrates how to easily install Amazon Q in VS Code and use it to create a starter FastAPI project, add a new route that returns a random number (the system automatically updated the tests as well), and explain the existing code.</p>\n<p>The tool is free</p>\n","date":"2024-05-08T02:47:37","month":5},{"title":"2024-05-04 19:13","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzw2OSFw9xI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzw2OSFw9xI</a></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">\n          <iframe \n            width=\"100%\" \n            height=\"400\" \n            src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zzw2OSFw9xI\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" \n            allowfullscreen>\n          </iframe>\n        </div>\n      </p>\n<p>The video shows the project <a href=\"https://github.com/wandb/openui\">OpenUI</a>, which <strong>automatically creates a frontend</strong>  based on the description - then the code can be downloaded or copied in various formats.
